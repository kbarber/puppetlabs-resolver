# Install and configure resolv.conf
#
# This installs and configures resolv.conf file which is used by the resident
# resolver library for DNS lookup.
#
# == Parameters
#
# === Common Parameters
#
# These parameters are normal parameters that affect the resolv.conf contents.
#
# [nameserver]
#   *Optional* An array of name servers.
# [domain]
#   *Optional* Queries for names within this domain can use short names
#   relative to the domain.
# [search]
#   *Optional* Search list for host-name lookup.
# [sortlist]
#   *Optional* This allows addresses returned by DNS to be sorted. It accepts
#   an ordered list of IP-address-netmask pairs. Netmask is optional.
# [ndots]
#   *Optional* Sets the threshold for the number of dots which must appear in
#   a query before an absolute query will be made.
# [timeout]
#   *Optional* Sets the amount of time the resolver will wait for a response
#   from a remote name server.
# [attempts]
#   *Optional* Sets the number of times the resolver will query its name 
#   servers.
# [rotate]
#   *Optional* If true causes round robin selection of nameservers from those
#   listed.
# [no_check_names]
#   *Optional* Disables checking of hostnames and mail names for invalid 
#   characters.
# [inet6]
#   *Optional* Attempt AAAA queries before A queries for hostname lookups.
# [ip6_bytestring]
#   *Optional* Causes reverse IPv6 lookups to be made using the bit-label 
#   format described in RFC 2673.
# [ip6_dotint]
#   *Optional* When set reverse IPv6 lookups are made in the ip6.int zone.
# [edns0]
#   *Optional* This enables support for the DNS extensions described in RFC 
#   2671.
#
# === Advanced Parameters
#
# These parameters affect the behaviour of this plugin, and are generally 
# automatically configured.
#
# [resolvconf_path]
#   *Optional* Modify this parameter if your resolv.conf file is not in the
#   normal place (/etc/resolv.conf). This is often used if your resolv.conf
#   is a symlink to another location.
# [resolvconf_content]
#   *Optional* A string which will contain the full contents of your
#   resolv.conf file. This allows the user to override the built-in behaviour
#   and provide their own custom content if they desire.
#
# == Examples
#
# Basic configuration:
#
#   class { 'resolver':
#     nameserver => ['127.0.0.1', '8.8.8.8'],
#     domain => "puppetlabs.com",
#     search => "lan.puppetlabs.com",
#   }
#
# Configuration with options:
#
#   class { "resolver':
#     nameserver => "127.0.0.1",
#     ndots => 2,
#     no_check_names => true,
#     timeout => 30,
#   }
